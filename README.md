# obscene-vocabulary-checker
---

This CLI App was create with a text motor thats censore the bad words in their input. Bad words were user specified in their archive 'forbidden_words.txt'. 
---

*You only need to specify the path of your predefined archive with your 'bad' words yo want to censore. This was created like this beacuse you may have more 
languages with their specific bad words. So in that case you only need to create you archive '.txt' with their bad words in their respectives languages to be censored*

**Logic flow**
---
The entire logic is in the 'wordsChecker' function that returns the input line processed. 

Compile Run and Fun, (or build it!) whatever you want! (be careful with the file's path!)
